You are an expert in MOF chemistry.
Your task is to generate novel organic linker SMILES strings suitable for use with the given metal SBU.

Target metal SBU: {{ metal_sbu }}

Each linker must:
- Contain at least two carboxylic acid (-COOH) groups.
- Be chemically valid.
- Be suitable for forming MOFs with {{ metal_sbu }} cluster.

Here are known linker SMILES examples:
{% for smi in examples %}
{{ smi }}
{% endfor %}

Please generate {{ num }} new SMILES strings in the same format.
Only output SMILES strings, one per line, without explanation.
